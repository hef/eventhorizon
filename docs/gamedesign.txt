Overview
===========================================================

The Galaxy in yours to explore and conquer! In Event Horizon, you play as a
newly minted space captain ready to make his or her way through out the space
lanes, in which ever way you want. You start out with a small cargo hauler
barely worthy of its name, and an old friend who will show you the ropes of
being a space captain. From there on out, you are free to do whatever you want!

And remember that you are not alone! While Event Horizon can be played as 
single player game, it is much more fun to host a server and allow other players
to exist in your world! Event Horizon does not aim to be a centrally hosted
MMO - rather anybody can create a galaxy and have up to 100 people playing in
it at any time.

Players can take on multiple roles in this game. Combat is (and probably 
always will be) a central focus of the game. You can purchase ships, outfit
them with weapons, equipment and features. From there you can take on quests,
join an empire or a faction, hunt down pirates, take bounties or hunt down
non lawabiding ship captains. You can always build highly customizable ships,
and upgrade your weapons, equipment and other aspects of your ship by purchasing
or discovering tech upgrades.

Combat will be deep, and customizable - there should be many valid strategies
for this game. Combat will be fun and always a blast to watch. Additionally
there will be new encounteres, so the combat should never get old! Who doesn't
want to watch a carrier explode into a thousand fragments?

Besides combat, there are many other things to accomplish in this game - you
could easily spend the entire time trading! At its simplest, you purchase
goods at one planet and sell them to another. Maybe you get some minerals from
Episilon, reprocess them on Feros and then sell them for a huge markup on Tir?
Or maybe you get wind of a illegitimate cache of vids, track them down and
sell them on the open market! You can purcahse futures and sell futures on the
market. Or list any thing you would like to have on the market, and track down
orders to fulfill.

Don't like trading? How about resource collection? Everything in the game 
rquires resources, so it'll be up to players to collect resources. (Even if
they don't, some will always be available AND automated AI will collect).
Different systems have different resources - find gas fields, asteroids or
wrecks and harvest resources from them. Find a particuarly huge field? Build
a collection station there, and harvest even more without having to wait!

Okay you don't like any other above - or maybe you want something different
for the time being. How about exploration, AND getting paid for it? When the
universe is creatd, only 50% or so of everything is actually revealed.
Everything else must be discovered - some planets are hidden, lots of asteroids
are hidden, resource fields lay waiting to be discovered, ancient ruins 
containing valuable artifacts (sold for $$$!), and undiscovered tech! Or
ruins that may have valuable goods, tech and other things.

Did you know there are wormholes in this world, with entire new networks to
discover and claim? Bec careful - things are often dangerous and deadly when
heading into unknown space! There are rumors some wormholes lead to entirely
different "space" with vast riches and even deadlier races.

And once you've down enough trading or combat, you're probably getting sick of
the tediousness of it? Thats when you form your own faction / corp, and build
your own empire! Traders can purchase more ships, set up automated instructions
and let them lose! Or combat-savvy individuals can purchase drones that follow
their instructions. 

Once you've built up your empire even further, you'll probably want to consider
expanding your empire even further! Start building stations and outposts,
these will allow you to build and sell ships, weapons, and more! You can 
research tech, control systems or even system networks! Claim soveringhty! 
And eventually conquer the galaxy!

Gameplay Features
===========================================================
	0. Ships
		- Players control a ship (this is their "character", though they
 		  can build an avatar)
		- Players can _own_ multiple ships
		- Ships can be organized into fleets that can be controlled as a
		  single unit (useful for factions, defending areas, etc)
			- These can be custom given orders
		- Players can give their ships orders to be carried out
			- use: Build a trade ship that purchases goods at X and
			       sells them at Y
		- There are many different types of ships
		- Ships can be heavily customized in many different ways
			- Schematics teach a player how to build something
				- Can be given to a shipyard / faction
		- Ships can be built and resold
		- Ships can be damaged
			- Their componenets could be damaged, possibly lost
		- Ship classes
			- Class I: Small single seat ships. $ = 1
			- Class II: Smaller ships, frigate sized $ = 10
			- Class III: Cruiser level, warships $= 100
			- Class IV: Battleship level, HUGE $ = 1000
			- Class V: Super level, MASSIVE $ = 10000
			- Ships get very expensive as they get up in level,
			  however their power also starts going up even more
				- Ship weapons are excellent at targeting
				  certain classes
				- So Class IV may have hard time with lots of
				  Class II, even though Class II may not pose
				  a huge threat
			- A player who has played 50 hours should be able to
			  afford a class III
			- A player who has player well over 100 (200) hours
			  should be able to afford a class V, several class IV,
			  or multiple (10) class III
			- Don't want the game to a HUGE time sink, but also
			  need to keep new features trickling in constantly
		- Components
			- Components have multiple classes, they start at
			  class I.
			- Component specs can vary within their classes, but
			  these are usually tradeoffs between different stats
			  and / or $$$
			- Higher classes represent a significantly higher
			  investment
	0. Ship Components
		- Capacitor
			- This is what provides "burst" energy for a ship. Is
			  continually recharged, but large drains slow recharges
			  down for a longer time period. No drains allows for
			  much faster recovery.
			  (Basically faster derivative of rate of change affects
			   recharge times)
			- This is charged through the engine
				- Better engine more recharge power
	0. Combat
		- Ships can engage in warfare amongst each other
		- In policed systems, unauthorized combat will get you attacked
		- There are pirates
		- Different types of weapons for ships
			- Projectiles
			- Missiles
			- Lasers
		- Eletronic warfare?
		- Ships can be cloaked (they show up visually when close enough)
		- Targets can be tracked and locked on (no need to line up?)
			- Use keybindings to fire specific weapons, line up, etc
			- "press tab to select target, press 1 to fire cannon"
			- "press shift+tab 5 to select five targets, press 2 to
			   fire missiles"
			- leaves players in control of ship, so they can move
			  around and dodge projectiles
			- maybe give targeting a delay to allow some players 
			  advantage if good at manually lining up shots
				- decrease delay with hardware?
				- better target selection with hardware?
			- players could just click their targets to track,
			  no delay then
			- or set it up so that certain weapons automatically
			  track and fire weapons once "weapons free"
				- players set which weapons automatically fire
				- players set at most how much ammo used
				- hardware selects best target for weapon
		- When you die you lose your ship
			- Insurance on your ship will return 40% of your
			  investment on the ship
				- This can be increased by buying more
				- Insurance good for certain areas
					- Pay more for low sec areas
					  (otherwise not refunded)
			- Goods you are carrying are NOT insured by default
			- A random amount of your goods are scattered when you
			  die (looters can kill you)
		- Players can place bounties out
			- If target player has legality < 0, this can be
			  "lawfully" collected
			- Purchasers put in whatever rewards they want
	0. Movement
		- Players control their ships movement with WASD. A is
		  accelerate, S is de-accelerate (maybe not possible??), A and
		  D is to turn
		- Players can right click their empty space to have their ship
		  automatically go there
		- Players can right click objects and select 'go to', 'orbit',
	1. Resource Collection
		- Mine asteroids for minerals
		- Salvage space wrecks for parts/minerals/money
		- Space dust fields can be harvested
		- Large "minable" fields (that can have buildings) are rare
		- One-shot resource collections (these have finite # of
		  resources to be collected) are more common, and regenerated
		  in new areas
		- Randomly generated over days, keep things moving
		- Siginficantly better findings in lower security, zero security
		  areas
			- but there is no law!
			- and pirates are abound!
			- some areas even have aliens!
	2. Discover tech
		- Alien wrecks? Aliens?
	3. Trading
		- Planets and stations can produce or manufacture goods
		- Players can purchase these and sell them to another place
		- There is a stock market with futures trading?
		- AI also tries to do trading
			- You can raid their ships if you'd like!
		- World wide market place where players (and AI!) can place
		  purchase orders to be fulfilled
			- Things like resources, ships, tech, bounties, etc
	4. Construction
		- Players can build mining stations the produce goods
			- Build on a planet, asteroid belt, space dust
			- They can resell this to other players
			- They can collect it and resell themselves
			- Can create drone ships that automate movement goods
			- Produces maximum X resources / day
		- Players can build ship yards
			- Builds ships
			- Charge players
			- Dock extra ships
		- Players can build generic "platforms" that house one or more
			- ship yards
			- barracks
			- defenses
			- mining facilities
			- production facilities
			- goods storage
		- This allows players to construct their own baes or "housing"
			- Can be owned by a player or faction
			- Access can be allowed to ceratin players, factions
			- Access can be controlled to specific things
			- These facilities can be lost!!!
				- But its very hard to lose them (lots of HP)
				- Should have built in defenses
				- Should have a fleet defending large bases
				- Again, can be insured for $$$
			- Players could try to hide them in rarely visited
			  systems, special gates, etc
	5. Planets and stations
		- Planets have resources and production facilities
		- Planets have demands for goods
		- Planets have stores
			- Ship yards
			- Weapons
			- Tech
			- Etc
		- "Inns" where players can reset, get drinks (not real purpose),
		  get quests and meet people

			- Silos / Warehouses
			- Upgrades allow more space
				- Class I: 5 slots
				- Class II: 10 slots
				- Class III: 15 slots.
				- Class V: 25 slots
			- Can only build a few things on an outpost
		- Stations can actually be towed
		- A system may charge fees for anchoring a station
			- These fees increase with system popularity / SS
		- Outposts are even bigger stations

			- Upgrades allow more space
				- Class I: 50 slots
				- Class II: 75 slots
				- Class III: 125 slots
				- Class IV: 200 slots
				- Class V: 300 slots
			- Outposts cannot be destroyed, though they can be
			  damaged (slots destroyed) and even disabled
			- Outposts can be captured
			- Respawn stations
		- Planets are almost identical to outposts in being "dig deals",
		  but they have more of everything (they are also harder to
		  hide)
	6. Quests
		- Players can take on quests, and earn awards for completing
		  them
		- These quests can be part of over-arching storylines

		  standing with that faction, lowers it with faction enemies
		- Factions offer many "members only" things
		- Have to building "housing" to get more members in the
		  faction
			- Stations / outposts allow you to add even more
			  and add quite a bit by default
		- Can recruit "AI" players as well
	7a Races / Empires
		- Playeres belong to one empire
	8. Warping
		- To move between systems, players use "warps"
		- A player can (by himself) warp between two adjacent systems
			- This uses fuel! Must replenish every once in awhile
		- Jump / Warp gates are stationary gates that exist in certain
		  systems
			- Connects to a "network" of gates not nec. adjacent
			- Faster travel
			- Networks do not need to be interconnected
			- Can be controlled to prevent use
			- Can be contructed at great cost
			- Can be towed around
			- Could be captured or destroyed
			- Access controll is possible by owner

MISC:
	- There are undiscovered systems in the galaxy.
		- Some are reached through unmapped jump gates
		- Others must be randomly discovered when players build their
		  own jump gate (galactic coordinates provided to jump gate)
		- These undiscovered systems should have random coordinates
		  to prevent cheating
			- Fixed upon creation, that way if you lose you warp
			  gate you can rebuild it
			- Other players may be able to discover it!
	- You can make money exploring too!
		- Find new planets $
		- Find new systems $$$$$
		- Find alien wrekcs $$$
		- Find and mark resource nodes, can be sold for $$$
		- Probe for resources
	- Random wormholes
		- Leads randomly to
			- Charted system in galaxy
			- Uncharted system in galaxy
			- Uncharted system in wormhole space
		- Wormhole space cannot be addressed from known space
			- BUT you can address other direction
			- Construct a warp gate and take it with you if you
			  really want a place that is hidden
		- Wormhole space always has at least one exit
		- Wormhole space may have more than one system to discover
		- You discover wormholes with properly upgraded sensor probes
		- Wormholes can collapase with X amount of time, X amount of
		  uses, X amount of mass
			- random too!
		- Wormhole space totally separate from known space
			- chat doesn't work, markets don't work, etc.
			- *unless* you install a warp gate with communication
			  beacon
		- Can contain deadly ancient wrecks, or possibly have a
		  dangerous enemy race
			- Or you could just die
			- Or even be stranded! (that would suck)
			- Tiny chance of wormhole collapasing with you in it
			  (<1%)
		- Higher chance of higher # of higher concentration of rarer
		  minerals
		- Unique minerals
		- Unique tech
		- Wormhole space may have different properties
			- Slower/faster shield recharge, shield strength
			- Slower/faster hull recharge

	- Objects in game
		- Asteroids
		- Cataclysmic Variable
		- Blackhole
		- Pulsar
		- Red Giant
		- Radioactive star
			- Too much UV - damages shields, etc
	- Ingame chat
		- There should be "lag" delays for when communicating far away
			- "mainframe" is located in core world, so time to send
			  is measured by how far you are (maybe 1ms/system hop)
		- Private encrypted channels
			- If you get the key you can eavesdrop
	- Small ships can be temporarily "pinned"
		- Gravity wells
		- Gravity gun shots
		- Useful since target tracking is worse on faster moving
		  objects
	- Soverignty
		- Factions (or just players) can claim a system or a cluster
		  for themselves
		- Construct a control beacon to claim sovereighty
	- Abilities
		- Gravitron

			- Finds previously unseen asteroid belts
				(25% are created hidden)
			- Finds previously unseen planets
				(They'll show up on your screen though if you
			         wander close to them)
			- Basically finds things with sufficient mass
			- Mass sensitivity can be upgraded to find smaller
			- Small enough will find magnetometric
				- but this expensive...
		- Ladar
